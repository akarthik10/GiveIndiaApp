  This is an Android application which aims to provide a portal for an NGO called Give India.

Introduction
=============
  
  Give India connects individuals with 150+ grassroot NGOs working for the poor in India. All organizations have been 
pre-screened by them so that you can trust that they will use your donation correctly.
By helping you donate to these charities online, they ensure that your giving is efficient and impactful.
They guarantee that 90% of your donation reaches the NGO you chose.

What does this App do?
=====================

  This app gives you power to search NGO's given your location from your handheld device without using GPS! Instead we
get your location from the cellID information. It also gives you ability to refer/recommend NGO's to your friends using
social media tools.
  It also has the ability to view all the people who have been talking about it and the current works the NGO's are
undertaking. 
  The app provides a rating mechanism based on which the NGO's are listed to the users. The different parameters under
consideration are location, the number of people who have been talking about it. Allows you to see NGO's recommended 
by your friends and as to where they have donated to.

Development
===========

This App has been developed using Eclipse for Android with ADT.
